## 🔒 Security & Authorization

* Firebase Security Rules enforce read/write access based on role
* Backend uses middleware to verify Firebase ID tokens and decode roles
* Admins can manage users, drivers, and bookings via secure endpoints

---

## ⏰ Scheduling

* Uses Firebase Cloud Functions with Pub/Sub to trigger actions (e.g., ride reminders)
* Scheduled rides stored in `/schedules` collection
* Cron-based triggers can notify drivers ahead of time

---

## 📡 Real-Time Features

* Ride requests are pushed to available drivers via Firestore listeners
* Status updates reflected in real-time on both driver and user dashboards

---

## 🛡️ Admin Dashboard Features

* See all registered users and drivers
* Approve or remove drivers
* Access complete ride history and logs
* Perform CRUD on any record
